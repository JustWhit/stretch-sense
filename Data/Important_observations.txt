Just putting ideas and observations down here:

1. User takes longer breath when working out.

2. Every exercise has a recommended breathing pattern which also constitutes proper form. For bench press: Exhale when lifting, Inhale on the way down. Now, we know when you inhale and exhale. If we also have a way of finding out whether you were pushing the weight or bringing it in during each cycle, we could give you feedback on form.

3. How is breathing affected as user gets tired? Patterns?

4. How much of the capacitance is muscle expansion/contraction? Is it separable? Does it provide same information as breathing or additional information?

5. Does it change with the weight you are lifting? What happens as you lift lower weight.

6. How consistent are these observations over various exercises. We don't need too many, but may be 2-3 for comparison. 

7. Eventually, we can do some preliminary analysis for aerobic exercises also.
